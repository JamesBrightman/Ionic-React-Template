This repo contains a basic Ionic-React app and can be used as a good starting point for creating your own apps. 
It constists of a Home page and 2 sub-pages. 

There is a split-pane menu which will render as a traditional hamburger menu on mobile devices. This means that the basics of routing have been implemented, so you don't need to spend time setting up a menu config from scratch ðŸŽ‰.
